## Alt UI
Bringing modern styling and features to WinForms

### About Alt UI
Alt UI is an attempt to create a simple, extensible control library which emulates standard WinForms controls, but with a more modern look and feel.
It does this with a mix of rounded corners, an a theme that matches your system settings.
For Windows 11, [StartAllBack](https://www.startallback.com)'s "Colorize Everything" option is recommended.

### Attributio
