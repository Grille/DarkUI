## Alt UI
Bringing modern styling and features to WinForms

### About Alt UI
Alt UI is an attempt to create a simple, extensible control library which emulates the look and feel of WinForms controls, but with a more modern look and feel, using colours from Windows itself, and Visual Studio 2022's dark theme.

### Attribution

Special thanks to the team over at [Ascension Game Dev](https://www.ascensiongamedev.com/) for expanding the library to include `DarkComboBox`, `DarkGroupBox`, and `DarkNumericUpDown`, aswell as [Robin Perris](http://www.robinperris.com) for the Original DarkUI this is based on, and anyone who contributed to [this specific fork.](https://github.com/Polo-Sul-Informatica/DarkUI2)

### How to use
It's basically a 1:1 recreation of standard WinForms controls, just add the DLL from this project as a reference, and use the controls from it.

You can also read the [original GitHub projects wiki](https://github.com/RobinPerris/DarkUI/wiki). This contains all the information you need to get started as well as more detailed information and guides.
